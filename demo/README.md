# DID WebVH Server Demo

## Pre-requisite

### Docker compose

Ensure you have docker compose installed. This can be verified with the following command.
`docker compose --version`

Instructions on how to install docker compose can be found here
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

### NGROK

We strongly recommend setting up a free ngrok account prior to going through this demo.

You can signup here:
https://dashboard.ngrok.com/

Once your account is created, you need to setup a free static endpoint and grab your API key.

You can setup a free static domain in the domain section once logged in:
https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains

To get an API key, go to the API key section:
https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys

Once you have your static domain and your API, proceed with the demo.

## Setting up you local deployments

Start by cloning the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/identity-foundation/didwebvh-server-py.git
cd didwebvh-server-py/demo/
```

Create your `.env` file and fill in the value using your ngrok account
`cp .env.demo .env`

Build and start the service
`docker compose up --build`

This will run the server along with an acapy agent and run a script to provision some dids/resources.

You can visit the webvh explorer at your ngrok domain.

## Load Testing

The `load_test.py` script allows you to create multiple DIDs with log entries and WHOIS files for performance testing.

### Running the Load Test

The script must be run from the server directory to access the required dependencies:

```bash
# From the repository root
cd server

# Set the API key for witness registration (optional, defaults to "webvh")
export API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run the load test
uv run python ../demo/load_test.py --help
```

**Note:** The load test automatically registers witness keys using the admin API. Make sure your API key has the necessary permissions.

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Create 10 DIDs with default settings (2 updates + WHOIS + schema each)
uv run python ../demo/load_test.py

# Create 50 DIDs with 3 updates each
uv run python ../demo/load_test.py --count 50 --updates 3

# Create 100 DIDs concurrently (much faster!)
uv run python ../demo/load_test.py -c 100 --concurrent

# Use custom server URL and namespace
uv run python ../demo/load_test.py -c 20 -s http://localhost:8000 -n mytest

# Create 100 DIDs with minimal updates (fastest)
uv run python ../demo/load_test.py -c 100 -u 1 --concurrent
```

### Parameters

- `-c, --count`: Number of DIDs to create (default: 10)
- `-s, --server`: DID WebVH server URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
- `-n, --namespace`: Namespace for test DIDs (default: loadtest)
- `-u, --updates`: Number of updates per DID (default: 2, minimum: 1)
- `--concurrent`: Run tests concurrently using async HTTP (up to 10 DIDs at once for maximum performance)

### What the Load Test Does

For each DID created, the script will:
1. **Register the witness key** in the known witness registry (via admin API)
2. Create an initial DID with witness signature and **watcher configured** (`https://did.observer`)
3. Perform the specified number of updates (each with witness signature)
4. Add a verification method to the DID
5. Create and upload a WHOIS verifiable presentation
6. **Create and upload an AnonCreds schema** as an attested resource

**DID Configuration:**
- Witness: Registered dynamically for each DID
- Watcher: `https://did.observer` (for monitoring and notification)

**Total log entries per DID**: `updates + 2` (initial + updates + verification method addition)  
**Resources per DID**: 1 AnonCreds schema

### Performance Metrics

The script reports:
- Total DIDs created (successful and failed)
- Total execution time
- Average time per DID
- Total log entries created
- Total AnonCreds schemas uploaded
- Throughput (DIDs per second)
