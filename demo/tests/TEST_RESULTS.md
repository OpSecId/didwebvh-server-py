# UNTP Pydantic Model Validation Test Results

## Summary

Created automated tests to validate our Pydantic models against official UNTP JSON schemas.

## Test Framework

- **File**: `test_pydantic_schemas.py`
- **Purpose**: Validate that our Pydantic models generate JSON that conforms to UNTP schemas
- **Schemas Tested**: 
  - Digital Conformity Credential (DCC) v0.6.0
  - Digital Identity Anchor (DIA) v0.6.0
  - Digital Product Passport (DPP) v0.6.0 (planned)

## Issues Found

### ConformityAttestation Model
1. **Missing `name` field** - Required by schema but not in our model
2. **`issuedToParty` type mismatch** - Should be `Organization` but we use `RegisteredIdentity`
3. **`regulation` type mismatch** - Should be `Regulation` but we use `Endorsement`

### FacilityVerification / ProductVerification
- These models wrap a nested object, but we're using them as if they're the facility/product directly
- Need to either:
  - Use these correctly with nested objects
  - Create simpler models for our use case
  - Use plain dicts for optional fields

## Recommendations

1. **Update Pydantic models** to match UNTP schema exactly
2. **Add `name` field** to `ConformityAttestation`
3. **Fix type relationships** between models
4. **Run tests after each model change** to ensure compliance
5. **Add test to CI/CD pipeline** once models are compliant

## How to Run Tests

```bash
cd /home/development/repos/didwebvh-server-py/demo
uv run python test_pydantic_schemas.py
```

## Next Steps

- [ ] Fix `ConformityAttestation` model
- [ ] Update `issuedToParty` to use correct type
- [ ] Update `regulation` to use `Regulation` model
- [ ] Add `assessedFacility` and `assessedProduct` properly
- [ ] Test DIA model
- [ ] Add DPP model and test
- [ ] Integrate with demo_script.py to use corrected models
